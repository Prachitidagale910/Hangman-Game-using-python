# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game, where the player must guess the letters of a randomly selected word before running out of lives.

## Game Overview

In this game:
- A random word is chosen from a predefined list.
- The player must guess one letter at a time.
- If the player guesses incorrectly, they lose a life.
- If the player loses all 6 lives, they lose the game.
- If the player guesses all the letters in the word before losing all lives, they win the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters of the chosen word.
3. Enter a letter you think is in the word.
4. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in its correct position(s).
5. If your guess is incorrect, you lose a life, and the hangman drawing progresses.
6. The game ends when:
   - You guess the word correctly and win.
   - You run out of lives and lose.

## Example Game Play

```
############################
#         HANGMAN          #
############################

The word has 8 letters: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Enter any letter: p

You guessed right! Current word: p _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Enter any letter: z

Wrong guess!
      ------
      |    |
      |    O
      |    
      |    
      |    
    --------
Lives left: 5

```

## Files

- **hangman.py**: The main Python script containing the game logic.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries are required. This game uses only built-in Python modules.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python hangman.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Customizing the Game

You can customize the game by changing the words in the `list_of_words` variable in the `hangman.py` script:

```python
list_of_words = ["prachiti", "flowers", "banana"]
```

Simply add or remove words to this list to create your own customized version of the game.
